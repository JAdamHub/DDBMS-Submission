1861306371301314698,Novo Nordisk Foundation,"The dyeing of denim traditionally relies on various harsh chemicals and causes significant environmental pollution. However, researchers in Denmark are aiming to change that through an innovative new dyeing method. The groundbreaking technique uses an aqueous solution of indican and near UV light to transform the compound indican into indigo directly on the yarn.

To advance this novel discovery, Katrine Qvortrup, Associate Professor at DTU Chemistry, and Senior Researcher Carsten Dam-Hansen from DTU Electro, have been awarded a Distinguished Innovator Grant from the Novo Nordisk Foundation for the research project, ""Indican-based light-driven blue denim dyeing for low-impact fashion.""

This grant will enable the researchers to fully optimise the reaction process and develop scalable systems for large-scale dyeing. Ultimately, they aim to create a continuous prototype dyeing system to efficiently dye yarn with minimal environmental and societal impact.",en,[],2024-11-26 07:09:54+00:00,Novo Nordisk

1861683104064368672,Novo Nordisk Foundation,"Join us for the last episode of our 4-part series marking the 100th anniversary of the Novo Nordisk Foundation in 2024.

Pandemics, energy crises, the explosion of cardiometabolic diseases, the climate crisis and humanitarian needs because of war and famine. With all these crises, the world needs action – now. And as the challenges become increasingly global, the Novo Nordisk Foundation has chosen to donate more and more funds beyond Denmark’s borders. This shift in direction has led to uncertainty. Isn’t it more sensible to invest the profits here in Denmark rather than spreading it thinly all over the world?

1846608289884524977,Camus,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: ""Today, over 100 members of Congress support a bill to fund Ozempic with Medicare at $1,500 a month. Most of these members have taken money from the manufacturer of that product, a European company called Novo Nordisk. As everyone knows, once a drug is approved for Medicare, it goes to Medicaid.
And there is a push to recommend Ozempic for Americans as young as six over a condition, obesity, that is completely preventable and barely even existed 100 years ago. Since 74% of Americans are obese, the cost of all of them, if they take their Ozempic prescriptions, will be $3 trillion a year. This is a drug that has made Novo Nordisk the biggest company in Europe.
It's a Danish company, but the Danish government does not recommend it. It recommends a change in diet to treat obesity and exercise. Virtually Novo Nordisk's entire value is based upon its projections of what Ozempic is going to sell to Americans. For half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised organic agriculture, organic food for every American three meals a day and gym membership for every obese American. Why are members of Congress doing the bidding of this Danish company instead of standing up for American farmers and children? Because Novo Nordisk is one of the largest funders of medical research, the media and politicians and the medical schools all go along with them.""",en,[],2024-10-16 17:44:59+00:00,Novo Nordisk
