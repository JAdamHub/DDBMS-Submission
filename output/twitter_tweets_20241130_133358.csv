1854737733119275452,Arjun Khemani,".@naval: There was a story that I read about @elonmusk that really affected me, which was when he was talking to Bill Gates, and Bill Gates had just taken out some huge short on Tesla. It was like a billion dollar short or something.

And, Elon was like, “Why would you do that? Why would you short Tesla?” And Bill goes, “Well, you know, I talked to my financial advisors and I looked at the math and there’s no way it’s overvalued. And so I’m going to make money on the short.”

And Elon goes, “What do you care about making money? I thought you were into electric cars and climate change and saving the world. What are you doing trying to save a few bucks and betting against Tesla?”. And he just walked away in disgust.

And I think he never talked to Bill Gates after that. And that’s when I realized, like, Elon’s a purist. He means what he says. The money is a tool for him to get what he’s trying to do. And so I take him at face value, which is the crazy thing, because a lot of people who set these audacious goals to inspire people, you kind of know they don’t really mean it.

Elon, I take at face value. So I really do think he intends to get to Mars. I don’t think he’s joking about that. And I think he means to get there within a defined window of time. And I don’t think it’s just like an inspirational, faraway goal. I think he’s very, very concretely going to do whatever it takes.

Because Elon doesn’t want to go down in history as the electric car guy or even the guy who saved America guy. He wants to go down as a guy who got humanity to the stars. Again, I’ll give him more credit than that. I don’t even think he wants to go down as the “I got humanity to the stars” guy.

He’s just like, “I want to get to the stars, and so I have to make it happen in this lifetime. The only way that I get to experience the science fiction world in my head is if I get to the stars.” And so that’s so inspirational. I think that drives everything.

So I think the government was just a thing that got in his way.",en,[],2024-11-08 04:08:29+00:00,Tesla

1860729498037281001,teslaway®️,"The Tesla Model Y is getting a major makeover called “Project Juniper.” Here are some of the cool changes we’ve heard about:

Battery and Charging

The new Model Y has generated buzz. Some speculate it might have a new battery system with increased energy storage. The base rear-wheel drive version might use a ‘CATL 6M’ battery pack with 62.5 kWh, slightly larger than the current 60 kWh CATL 6L unit. It’s lighter and could charge faster, possibly up to 350 kW with an 800-volt architecture, a significant leap from current models.

Headlights and Tail Lights

Headlights: The Model Y’s front might have some cool features from the Cybertruck and Cybercab. It could have a full-width light bar at the front of the hood for daytime running lights, with the main beam lights lower down, giving it a split headlamp look. They also said there might be a front bumper camera for better parking and safety, like what Tesla tested in other models.
  
Tail Lights: The rear of the Model Y is getting a makeover with a full-width light bar that connects new, C-shaped tail lamps. This design change will make the Model Y look more modern and put-together, different from the current model. The light bar will also have the Tesla script in the middle, replacing the old “T” logo.

Safety Features

They might add an ‘Active Hood’ feature. It raises the rear part of the hood in a crash to give more space between the hood and the engine parts. This could help keep pedestrians safer.

In Europe, they might make adaptive headlights standard. They change based on how you steer and how fast you’re going. This makes it easier to see at night when you’re turning.

——

These design changes are all about making the Model Y look and work better. They’re more like the new designs Tesla has been using in other models, like the Model 3 Highland. But these are just rumors and guesses from online sources. We’ll know for sure when Tesla announces them or when the new version of Model Y comes out.

Three kids are dead, BURNED ALIVE, and another is seriously burned, because the Cybertruck they were in burst into flames, after an accident. EVs are inherently dangerous. They might have survived, if they’d been in any other vehicle.
I came upon a very minor, single-vehicle accident with a Nissan Leaf and the EV burst into flames, while I was on the phone with 911, less than 1 minute after the accident. The driver hit a road sign, ran over it and the curb. That’s all it took, for the car to erupt into flames. 
Not only are EVs dangerous, they’re worse for the environment than gasoline-powered vehicles. 
Drive an EV at your own risk. Even if you have two fire extinguishers in your EV, the fires are extremely difficult to extinguish. They continue to reignite. 
If Elon is smart, he’ll settle with the 4 families, before they can even file lawsuits, but it won’t bring back their dead children. It won’t heal the burns of the lone survivor.",en,[],2024-11-30 03:31:54+00:00,CyberTruck

1861980182695072198,Race,"A fatal crash involving a Tesla Cybertruck occurred early Wednesday in Piedmont, California, resulting in three deaths and one serious injury. The accident happened around 3:08 a.m. when the Cybertruck mounted a curb, struck a cement wall, and became wedged between the wall and a tree. The front of the vehicle caught fire.

The Cybertruck’s automated emergency alert system notified authorities immediately after the crash. Three occupants were pronounced dead at the scene, while a passerby rescued a fourth person, who was hospitalized with severe injuries. Investigators suspect speed may have been a factor, but the involvement of drugs or alcohol has not been ruled out.

This tragic event highlights concerns about vehicle safety and comes as Tesla’s Cybertruck, which has been on the market for about a year, faces scrutiny following multiple recalls. The investigation into the crash is ongoing.",en,[],2024-11-28 03:47:24+00:00,CyberTruck
