1836851851800592638,Mike Rundle,"Apple broke the Photos app in iOS 18 because they stopped thinking about it as a Utility and started treating it like an app they are trying to grow casual usage of, which is insane.

Apple‚Äôs goal should **never** be to increase usage of it like it‚Äôs some social product or game. Their goal should be to provide whatever a user is trying to find when they open it.

Here are my primary use cases:

(1) I need to find an item in my library that was added recently so I can edit it, share it, copy it, etc.

(2) I need to find an item that was added to my library long enough ago that just scrolling back and glancing at thumbnails quickly is laborious or won‚Äôt lead to success without frustration

For #1, the best way to solve that is to show me a chronological list of items as quickly as possible

For #2, the best way to solve that is to have a Search feature that can accept arbitrary queries like ‚Äúpumpkin patch‚Äù or ‚Äúlast Thanksgiving‚Äù or ‚Äúbaby pics‚Äù or ‚ÄúDad with a beard‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt care about moments, slideshows, dynamic collections, memories, or anything else Photos is trying to put in my face. I don‚Äôt open Photos to stroll down memory lane, I open it for 1 of the 2 use cases outlined above.

So what did Apple do?

They jumbled the quick list of recent items with a bunch of dynamic collections and memories into a new main screen, but more egregiously they took Search out of the tab bar (closest to my thumb) and put it at the top right of the screen, which is the 2nd hardest region to reach when holding a phone.

Moving Search to an ergonomically inconvenient location would be bad enough, but Apple designers took it a frustrating step further by shrinking the tap target wayyyyyy down from iOS 17.

How much smaller is it?

91% smaller by area compared to the iOS 17 tab. 91% fewer individual pixels to try to tap on, now placed in the most inconvenient location they could find.",en,2024-09-19 19:36:23+00:00,Apple

1862538706822803664,Paul Berg,"A manifesto for MEGA: Make Europe Great Again üá™üá∫

Dear EU bureaucrats,

We're done.

‚Ä¢ Done with your excessive regulations.
‚Ä¢ Done with your anti-tech stance.
‚Ä¢ Done with your degrowth mindset.
‚Ä¢ Done with your socialist policies.
‚Ä¢ Done with your woke bullshit.
‚Ä¢ Done with your risk-averse attitude.

It's time to Make Europe Great Again.

‚Üí Celebrate Entrepreneurship

We've grown complacent‚Äîtaking centuries of progress for granted, as if new technology comes to us on a silver platter.

We're stuck in a local maximum, blind to how much better things could be if we allowed free markets to lead the way.

We're driving away our entrepreneurs with pointless red tape and silly taxes on unrealized gains.

This has to STOP.

Entrepreneurship should be encouraged and celebrated.

‚Üí Embrace Technology

Technology is the frontier of the future, but we're mere spectators on the global stage‚Äînot pioneers.

This is not due to a lack of talent. Europe is home to a world-class talent pool.

The problem? We‚Äôve made it nearly impossible for entrepreneurs to thrive here.

Worse still, we‚Äôve forgotten that science and technology aren‚Äôt optional extras‚Äîthey are the only tools capable of solving our most pressing problems. Actually, all problems.

It‚Äôs time to change course. Time to EMBRACE technology like our lives depend on it‚Äîbecause they kinda do.

‚Üí Seize the Opportunity with the US

Trump and Musk are steering the US toward significant economic and technological growth, and potentially making humanity a multiplanetary species.

Meanwhile in the EU, we're busy clicking on cookie banners.

The courage and determination of the US are the spirit we need to rekindle at home.

Right now, we have a rare opportunity to restructure Europe, follow in the footsteps of the US, and make the West stronger.

We need our own @DOGE to undo the nonsensical regulations and cut wasteful spending.

Repeal GDPR. Repeal MiCA. Repeal DMA. Repeal the AI Act. Repeal the other baloney regulations.

‚Üí Rediscover Our Roots

It's a shame that the land that gave birth to the Enlightenment‚Äîa beacon of reason, freedom, and innovation‚Äîis dimming its own light.

We're hesitating on the brink of our potential.

The Enlightenment wasn't just a historical period; it was a mindset‚Äîa commitment to challenge, to question, and to advance.

We owe it to our forebears and ourselves to REIGNITE that flame.

""The end of law is not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom.""

‚Äï John Locke, Second Treatise of Government

‚Üí Europe, Wake Up!

We must change our culture to one that is:

‚Ä¢ Pro-progress
‚Ä¢ Pro-tech
‚Ä¢ Pro-entrepreneurship
‚Ä¢ Pro-science
‚Ä¢ Pro-freedom of speech
‚Ä¢ Pro-free markets
‚Ä¢ Anti-overregulation

We must also ensure that every immigrant who settles in Europe assimilates and adheres to these cultural values.

So here we are, standing at a crossroads.

Will we keep sleepwalking like zombies in a bureaucratic nightmare, or will we wake up, snap out of it, and reclaim our legacy of freedom and innovation?

The choice is ours. The time is now.

The best ideas don't always reinvent the wheel.

They take something that works and make it better across one or multiple domains.

--> Amazon: Walmart but online
--> Uber: Created a new peer-to-peer business model for taxis
--> Netflix: Blockbuster but online
--> SpaceX: Drastically lowered the cost of space travel

Here are 10 ways to innovate in your Company.

1. 10X Thinking:
10X thinking focuses on achieving transformative goals, rather than incremental changes.

2. Blue Ocean Strategy:

3. Business Model Canvas:
The Business Model Canvas is a one-page tool for outlining how businesses create and capture value.

4. Business Model Navigator:
The Business Model Navigator explores various business model patterns, serving as a cookbook for success.

5. Creative Problem Solving:
Creative Problem Solving involves diverging to generate options and converging to select the best solutions.

6. Design Thinking:
Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation. It's about understanding users deeply and prototyping solutions quickly.

7. Innovation Ambition Matrix:
The Innovation Ambition Matrix visualizes and balances various types of innovation projects in your portfolio.

8. Jobs to Be Done:

9. Lean Startup:
Lean Startup emphasizes rapid, cost-effective testing of business ideas to minimize the risk of failure.

10. McKinsey 3 Horizon:
The McKinsey 3 Horizon model balances current and future business opportunities, managing innovation across time frames.

‚ÄúThere has to be a tight feedback loop on innovation.¬†

One of the things that is advantageous for the way SpaceX operates is that the engineering team and the production team are in the same facility, and there is good communication back and forth.¬†

As the engineers see that they've designed something that is difficult to manufacture, they can adjust their design quickly, to make it easier to build.¬†

The pace at which we're able to do new versions of the rocket is also much faster.‚Äù
